# Getting Started

This section helps you get the project running and understand its structure.

## In This Section

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Quick Start](quick-start.md) | Get the project running in minutes |
| [Project Structure](project-structure.md) | Understand the codebase organization |
| [Development Environment](development-environment.md) | Configure your development tools |

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.14+** - The project uses modern Python features
- **Docker** - For running PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO
- **uv** - Fast Python package manager ([install guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))

## Recommended Path

1. **[Quick Start](quick-start.md)** - Get the application running locally
2. **[Project Structure](project-structure.md)** - Understand where things are located
3. **[Development Environment](development-environment.md)** - Set up your IDE and tools
4. **[Tutorial](../tutorial/index.md)** - Learn by building a feature

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the Getting Started section, head to the [Tutorial](../tutorial/index.md) to learn the architecture by building a complete feature.
